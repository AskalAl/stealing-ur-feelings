**Concept Description**

*Stealing Ur Feelings* is a short (~7 minute) web-based interactive documentary film. Using a combination of filmed content, AR and game mechanics, it will reveal how Snapchat can use your face to secretly collect data about your emotions. It's going to be fun, fast, funny, and intended for a non-technical audience.

From the very first frame of the film, we'll tell the audience why they should care:

Your feelings are worth money. And right now, someone could be stealing them right from under your nose... and selling them to corporations, politicians and powerful entities who can use them to do very bad things.

Structurally, the film will present the narrative in 3 short, interconnected acts:

PART 1: HOW ARE FEELINGS STOLEN?
We'll explain how AI can extract your emotions simply by analyzing your face. We'll dive into the science of facial feature detection and algorithmic emotion recognition, in relatable terms, for a non-technical audience. 

PART 2: WHY ARE ANYONE'S FEELINGS WORTH MONEY?
We'll illustrate some of the ways that a corporation could extract valuable data about consumer behavior and public opinion simply by correlating your emotions with the content you consume. For example: A company could scan chats for mentions of a pop singer's name, aggregate the correlated emotional responses of every 21 year old in Nebraska, and sell that data, as a regional Q Score, to the singer's tour bookers.  Or what if Snapchat quantified the emotions of every snap reply... to determine who their LEAST interesting users are, so as to secretly penalize them in discovery algorithms? What if a corporation found out how swing state voters emotionally react to news about Trump, and sold that data to influence the 2020 election?

PART 3: WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?
Here's our call to action. We cement the idea that AI is advancing faster than perhaps many people realize, and that while your favorite app might be free to use, you could be paying for it in some other ways. When you give a corporation access to your camera and your face, a tradeoff occurs: You gain entertainment, but you risk being quantified and sold. We'll challenge people to make more informed choices, and maybe we'll even link to resources with more information.

The film will employ some novel technology to create interactivity, including a realtime AR filter and a gamified visualization of the behind-the-scenes world of emotion recognition. I created a rough prototype to illustrate some of the possibilities. It requires a computer with a webcam:

https://noahlevenson.github.io/stealing-ur-feelings/tech-demo/

I think my concept has already achieved some major successes in addressing the goals of this awards track:

The prototype proved that this concept works. It's native to the internet, discoverable to broad audiences online, and takes advantage of the unique medium that is the internet. It also received very enthusiastic feedback from my beta testers. They really enjoyed the interactivity and were delighted by what was happening in their browser. Everyone wanted to share it.

I've also worked to find a great story which engages audiences around issues related to AI and machine learning through screen-based media. Time has been spent finding an internet-friendly structure and focusing the scope of the narrative, much of which is reflected in my concept description above. 

The central conceit of the concept is to REVEAL something about AI and machine learning to a non-technical audience. This serves to increase public awareness of the issues these technologies present in our increasingly quantified society. The project specifically addresses the internet health issue of privacy.

I've been working on this concept for 12 days. I developed it specifically as an application for this awards track.

This award would amplify my work in many ways. Though I have partners to help publicize my projects, Mozilla's large platform and trusted voice could help these ideas reach a broader audience than ever before. Mozilla's network of creators, technologists, activists and thinkers are precisely the kinds of partners whose support could really help this work raise awareness... and together, we could help avert an actual dystopia! The money helps too: It'll help me make a more arresting product, with higher production value, which more people will find compelling. And it'll give me the freedom to focus maximum energy on not only the work, but also on working to generate public excitement and anticipation for the project by publicly chronicling its development.

My concept does meet the specific award criteria for this awards track. Here's how:

It is in-progress work at the prototype stage. The work will be freely available on the web. The work is suitable for a non-expert audience and has demonstrated the potential to be broadly shared. The project is designed to respect the user's privacy. No data will be collected or stored, all sharing mechanisms will be as privacy-respecting as possible, etc.

**Users**

For a general idea of the UI/UX, check out the rough wireframes I created:

https://noahlevenson.github.io/stealing-ur-feelings/media/wireframes_07112018.pdf

The users of this project will likely represent a broad spectrum of people who want to be entertained, but I anticipate that there will be a core constituency of millennial and gen-z users who are demographically similar to the users of Snapchat and Instagram. Our users, like most internet users, are impatient, short on time, and are likely using our website while they're at work. They need it to be easy and to work well on the first try.

The UX design has 2 goals:

1. Start telling the story as soon as the user arrives at the home page, even before the movie begins

2. Maximize simplicity and intuitiveness

Addressing goal #1: The home page juxtaposes a live AR filter using the viewer's webcam stream with a video loop of content that is likely to provoke strong emotions. By doing this, we begin to visually establish the controlling ideas of our story: 

You are reacting to content all day, and there is a privacy tradeoff that occurs when you give access to your device camera and face. 

(It's also an elegant solution to a tech challenge: We need to validate the user's camera setup to ensure that we have a positive face track before we begin the experience).

Addressing goal #2: We aim to make every phase of the experience feel seamless and integrated. The home page is designed in an HD 16x9 layout so it feels like a fluid, connected preamble to the interactive film itself. When the film is over, that sense of continuity is maintained by gracefully returning the user to the home page. Overall, we keep options to a minimum and communicate using a simple, clear visual language.

The interactive experience will provide simple instructions to the user for how to best participate in the interactive segments. (We may instruct the user to make different faces to test the algorithms, etc.) The goal for any interactivity which requires explanation is to teach it in a fun, organic way -- much like an interactive tutorial at the beginning of a video game.

Regarding user research: I've subjected a number of beta testers to the tech demo I produced, and the feedback was very promising. Additionally, I experimented extensively while developing my previous interactive film, and its viral success has led me to carry over many of its better UX ideas.

<br/><br/>
**Community**

My concept has no specific geographic focus area, but I anticipate that the demographic will skew towards a younger (millennial and gen-z) crowd that is approximately consistent with the users of Snapchat and Instagram.

To engage these target audiences, the goal is to make a piece of entertainment that is similar in tone to a viral Youtube video -- it'll feature a young and relatable host, it'll be fast and fun and cutty and full of memey internet humor. (I've historically had some good success in this particular domain.)

This younger audience loves the internet and their mobile apps, but like most people, they're likely unaware of the spooky realities of emotion recognition. My concept benefits audiences by educating them. By revealing the ways that AI can be applied without your knowledge and in potentially destructive ways, *Stealing Ur Feelings* aims to help audiences make more informed decisions about how they engage with technology and to become active participants in protecting their own privacy.

<br/><br/>
**Working Open**
I've created a public GitHub repository which serves as a living open workspace:

https://github.com/noahlevenson/stealing-ur-feelings

This page is designed to document and share the concept with broad audiences, particularly those without a technical background.

However, for those who are programmers or technologists, there's also plenty of source code to read through :)

All of the work generated for the project will live in this repository -- including written materials, art, tests, tech demos, etc.

The page has been engineered to draw attention to key media and "must see" items that best represent the current status of the project. Additionally, a strategically placed changelog gives viewers a quick visual timeline of our current progress.

<br/><br/>
**Internet Health**

My concept addresses the Internet Health area of privacy. 

In the 2018 Internet Health Report, it was mentioned that corporations are gaining unfettered access to our personal lives, using AI to interpret massive amounts of data, and ultimately using their acquired power to move into adjacent businesses.

This -- the way that corporations can violate our privacy and sell information about us to the highest bidder in their quest to accumulate power -- is where *Stealing Ur Feelings* intends to make a positive change. 

When the Cambridge Analytica scandal was exposed, my first thought was, "Duh! How could people not realize that Facebook was up to no good?"

My second thought was a sudden realization: Non-technical people are not as skeptical of the apps and services they use simply because they're not as aware of the bad stuff that technology is capable of.

*Stealing Ur Feelings* aims to make the internet healthier by spreading awareness of the tradeoff that occurs when you give a corporation like Snapchat access to your camera and your face: You may be gaining entertainment, but you're also exposing yourself to quantification.

Most importantly, *Stealing Ur Feelings* seeks to accomplish this goal by presenting these ideas in ways that non-technical people will understand and find entertaining.

If more consumers become aware of the Not Very Nice Things that are possible -- and will soon become possible -- via machine learning and AI, then hopefully they'll make better, more informed decisions about what apps and services they'll pay for and share their data with.

Smarter consumers making better choices will make it harder for ill-intentioned corporations to thrive, and ideally we'll all benefit from a more open, less centralized internet with fewer bad actors disrespecting our privacy.

<br/><br/>
**Field Survey**

After performing quite a bit of internet research, it appears that no other individuals or organizations are working on similar concepts.

There's no shortage of pro-business articles enthusiastically praising emotion recognition for its ability to help corporations quantify their customers (and even their own employees), as well as quite a bit of content glorifying the new and exciting ways that advertisers will study our faces to sell us more products -- but there is a stunning lack of content created from a pro-consumer perspective.

<br/><br/>
**Award Funds**

I'll be writing, directing, producing and editing the film -- as well as doing all the programming and web development myself -- but there are still some roles and services I'll need to hire for.  Here's a non-exhaustive list of expenses I'm anticipating for a small multi-day film shoot and post production:

Director of photography / second camera operator + kit rental ($4000)
Location audio mixer / boom operator ($2000)
Production assistant ($1000)
Film colorist ($2000)
Motion graphics artist (for film titles + gfx) ($3000)
Illustrator/animator for AR props ($3000)
Post production VO recordist / audio mixer + studio fees ($3000)
Equipment transportation ($500)
Hard drives ($500)
Crew meals ($500)
Expendables ($500)
Music and stock footage licensing (TBD)

It would also be nice to earmark a small portion of the award funds to subsidize my living expenses during production, so that I can focus maximum time and energy on the project.
