### STEALING UR FEELINGS

Meet the new AI that knows you better than you know yourself.

*Stealing Ur Feelings* is an augmented reality experience that reveals how your favorite apps can use facial emotion recognition technology to make decisions about your life, promote inequalities, and even destabilize American democracy.

It premiered at the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival. **Stay tuned for announcements about our internet premiere.**

The project is supported by a $50,000 grant from the NetGain partnership -- a collaboration between Mozilla, MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, Knight Foundation, and the Open Society Foundations. 

*Stealing Ur Feelings* began life as an application for Mozilla's 2018 [awards for art and advocacy exploring artificial intelligence](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/06/04/mozilla-announces-225000-for-art-and-advocacy-exploring-artificial-intelligence/). **This repository is an open workspace.** Check back often for updates!
